I couldn't really believe my ears when I heard the judge declare that:

- CSW is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper.
- CSW is not the person who operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011.
- CSW is not the person who created the Bitcoin System.
- CSW is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.

After years of gaslighting and harassment (I just noticed that my first post about this was from 2016, back when Gavin fell under his influence), I did not expect this much sanity from the legal system.

Remember: Craig Wright is a fraud. Not only that, but an all-out awful person that uses his fraud as a pretense to willingly ruin people's lives. He deserves whatever is coming to him. Or, just to be forgotten.

Now that this is over, I might become more active in bitcoin development again. No promises though. The last few years have been difficult for me, for this reason and others. But it absolutely helps to have this out of the way.

This is not only a win for bitcoin, but for open source development in general. It's good to remind copyright trolls that even if they have enormous financial backing and the willingness to forge pile after pile of documents, they will lose.

Here's a copy of the whitepaper to celebrate: [bitcoin.pdf](/assets/2024/3/19/bitcoin.pdf) (SHA256 `b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553`).
